## Abstract
Existing temporal action localization (TAL) works rely on a large number of training videos with exhaustive segment-level annotation, preventing them from scaling to new classes. As a solution to this problem, few-shot TAL (FS-TAL) aims to adapt a model to a new class represented by as few as a single video. Exiting FS-TAL methods assume trimmed training videos for new classes. However, this setting is not only unnatural â€“ actions are typically captured in untrimmed videos, but also ignores background video segments containing vital contextual cues for foreground action segmentation. In this work, we first propose a new FS-TAL setting by proposing to use untrimmed training videos. Further, a novel FS-TAL model is proposed which maximizes the knowledge transfer from training classes whilst enabling the model to be dynamically adapted to both the new class and each video of that class simultaneously. This is achieved by introducing a query adaptive Transformer in the model. Extensive experiments on two action localization benchmarks demonstrate that our method can outperform all the stateof-the-art alternatives significantly in both single-domain and cross-domain scenarios.

## Summary
- First Few-Shot TAL setting to use Untrimmed Videos for both Support and Query 
- Unified Model can accomodate both Untrimmed and Trimmed Video without design change
- Instead of meta-learning the entire network, only Transformer is meta-learned hence faster adaptation.
- Intra-Class Variance is handled using this adaptation
- Promising performance in Cross-Domain/Dataset settings.
