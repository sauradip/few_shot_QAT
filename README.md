## Abstract
Existing temporal action localization (TAL) works rely on a large number of training videos with exhaustive segment-level annotation, preventing them from scaling to new classes. As a solution to this problem, few-shot TAL (FS-TAL) aims to adapt a model to a new class represented by as few as a single video. Exiting FS-TAL methods assume trimmed training videos for new classes. However, this setting is not only unnatural â€“ actions are typically captured in untrimmed videos, but also ignores background video segments containing vital contextual cues for foreground action segmentation. In this work, we first propose a new FS-TAL setting by proposing to use untrimmed training videos. Further, a novel FS-TAL model is proposed which maximizes the knowledge transfer from training classes whilst enabling the model to be dynamically adapted to both the new class and each video of that class simultaneously. This is achieved by introducing a query adaptive Transformer in the model. Extensive experiments on two action localization benchmarks demonstrate that our method can outperform all the stateof-the-art alternatives significantly in both single-domain and cross-domain scenarios.

## Summary
- First Few-Shot TAL setting to use Untrimmed Videos for both Support and Query 
- Unified Model can accomodate both Untrimmed and Trimmed Video without design change
- Instead of meta-learning the entire network, only Transformer is meta-learned hence faster adaptation.
- Intra-Class Variance is handled using this adaptation
- Promising performance in Cross-Domain/Dataset settings.
- Can localize Actions for a class having a minimum of just **1** annotated video

## Qualitative Performance

## Dependencies
* Python == 3.7
* Pytorch==1.1.0 or 1.3.0
* CUDA==10.0.130
* CUDNN==7.5.1_0
* GCC >= 4.9
* pip install git+https://github.com/luizgh/visdom_logger.git

## Installation
Based on the idea of ROI Alignment from Mask-RCNN, GTAD's author developed **SGAlign layer** in their implementation. You have to compile a short cuda code to run Algorithm 1 in [GTAD](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11462).

1. Create conda environment
    ```shell script
    conda env create -f env.yml
    source activate gtad
    ```
2. Install `Align1D2.2.0`
    ```shell script
    cd gtad_lib
    python setup.py install
    ```
3. Test `Align1D2.2.0`
    ```shell script
    python align.py
    ```
4. Post-processing : Download the CUHK classifier from this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1--d6V5xeVWznO0cPI_47f5wWGL8RO6P0/view?usp=sharing) and place it in "data" folder
   
## Pretrained Models

The pretrained models of Base Class training and also the QAT Transformer Checkpoints have been uploaded in this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19d4thM_ywioMpkzAWUM0LEdyneL59_CF?usp=sharing). Download and put in the `./output` directory.

## Training and Evaluation

Appologize for the messed up Code  

Refactoring will be done soon ( delay due to CVPR workload ) ( Thanks to [Frost](https://github.com/frostinassiky) for debugging on the way )

> To Train GTAD with base class split run this ( only needed once per dataset )

```train 
python gtad_train_fs.py 
```

> To Train on support split and Test on query split run this

```test
python gtad_inference_fs_inductive.py --meta_learn True --shot 5 --multi_instance False
python gtad_inference_fs_inductive.py --meta_learn False --shot 5 --multi_instance False
python gtad_c3d_postprocess_fs.py
```
